# Hyprland ricing - first attempt

So here's my first attempt at ricing Hyprland. Haven't thought I'd enjoy it as much as I am. A bit colorful... which for me is a nice change.

Issues? Warning in the waybar css file. For some reason (I still haven't figured why) workspace switcher behaves differently (or I'm not seeing something) than the rest of the modules - which forced me to use min. height.

EDIT - luckily first bunch of css cleanups for waybar are done. Still some optimizations to do, but now it's much more managable.

Currently using wofi as app launcher - but will probably switch to rofi. Because of 2 reasons: somehow it is case sensitive with flatpak apps and also I'm using rofi for bluetooth module (which is currently disabled as I'm getting the same functionality from tray).

Currently using Ghostty as terminal... will test with Wezterm. Also will move back to default behavior with window title module and will set overrides for web browsers and other apps where I really don't want to get super long titles.

I'm still unsusre about active window border - will experiment with different colors and 1px border.

All in all - super fun. And I wouldn't consider using other DEs (Hyprland bacame my main one on the desktop)... but remote desktop is still tricky on Wayland and currently RDP only works well only on Gnome (and almost well on KDE). Hope I'll find some replacment.
